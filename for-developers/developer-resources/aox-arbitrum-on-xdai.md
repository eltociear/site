# AoX: Arbitrum on xDai

Arbitrum has been deployed to xDai - AoX! We are currently working on configs and bridge installation, [Blockscout is already configured for AoX](https://blockscout.com/xdai/aox/). Look for more info and instructions coming soon.

For information on Arbitrum and usage basics, see the [Arbitrum docs](https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/developer_quickstart). Note that AoX is still being finalized on xDai, and some functionality is not yet available.

## Deposits to AoX

Simple deposit functionality for users / bridge implementation is still in development. Devs can use the following ABI to call the  `depositEth` method. Use 0 for `maxSubmissionCost` and attach an amount of xDai tokens to the transaction. It may take several minutes for execution finalization. 

* [Deposit Example Transaction](https://blockscout.com/xdai/mainnet/tx/0x9cf6d6b352e5788ed2edea164431980d237c287ecf4a4ae0e7aca234ca9c42b1)
* ABI â¬‡

      },
      {
