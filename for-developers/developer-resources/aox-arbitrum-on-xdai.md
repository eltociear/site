# AoX: Arbitrum on xDai

Arbitrum has been deployed to xDai - AoX! We are currently working on configs, bridge installation and explorer integration. Look for more info and instructions coming soon.

For information on Arbitrum and usage basics, see the [Arbitrum docs](https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/developer_quickstart). Note that AoX is still being finalized on xDai, and some functionality is not yet available.

## Deposits to AoX

Simple deposit functionality for users / bridge implementation is still in development. Devs can use the following ABI to call the  `depositEth` method. Use 10000000 for `maxSubmissionCost` and attach an amount of xDai tokens to the transaction. It may take several minutes for execution finalization.
