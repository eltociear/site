# 7) Call Contract Methods using MyCrypto

Next you will set a temporary zero fee in the `Registry` contract for registering addresses at the bootnode rpc.

&#x20;a) Check the bootnode ip is accessible in a browser. \
Visit [https://1.2.3.4 ](https://1.2.3.4) (using the bootnode's ip address). You may see a warning that the certificate is invalid. Click **Advanced** and proceed and unlock the browser. You should now see a message like "**Used HTTP Method is not allowed. POST or OPTIONS is required**". This means the bootnode is ready for the next step.

2. URL is https://1.2.3.4 (using your bootnode ip)
3. Keep currency as ETH
4. Save and Use Custom Node

9\) Repeat the process above  to call the `reserve`  & `setAddress` methods

* `Master of Ceremony` should first call `reserve` method with `_name = 0x6d3815e6a4f3c7fcec92b83d73dda2754a69c601f07723ec5a2274bd6e81e155` ( enter verbatim, this is the keccak hash of  `"service_transaction_checker"`.
* Then call `setAddress` method with:
  * \_name = `0x6d3815e6a4f3c7fcec92b83d73dda2754a69c601f07723ec5a2274bd6e81e155`,
  * \_key = `A`&#x20;
  * \_value = `0xCERTIFIER_CONTRACT_ADDRESS`
