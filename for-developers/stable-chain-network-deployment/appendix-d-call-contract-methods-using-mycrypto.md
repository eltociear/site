&#x20;a) Check the bootnode ip is accessible in a browser. \
Visit [https://1.2.3.4 ](https://1.2.3.4) (using the bootnode's ip address). You may see a warning that the certificate is invalid. Click **Advanced** and proceed and unlock the browser. You should now see a message like "**Used HTTP Method is not allowed. POST or OPTIONS is required**". This means the bootnode is ready for the next step.
