# 2) AWS Initial Setup

1\) Register (if you haven't already) and login to the AWS management console: [https://aws.amazon.com/console/](https://aws.amazon.com/console/)\


2\) To create credentials for the cli, open IAM home [https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home), select **Users** on the left navigation bar and click the **Add User** button.&#x20;

3\) Pick a username, check **Programmatic access** for **AWS access type**, and click the **Next: Permissions** button.

{% hint style="info" %}
For clarity we recommend using identical usernames on your Ansible Control Station and your remote node. For example, create a user named "ubuntu" on both your Ansible Control Station and your remote node.
{% endhint %}

4\) Choose any of the available options - **Attach existing policies directly** is the simplest one. In the list of policy types, search for and select **AmazonEC2FullAccess**.  Click the **Next:Tags** button.

5\) Enter any Tags (optional) and Click the **Next:Review** button. IAM tags are key-value pairs you can add to your user. Tags can include user information, such as an email address, or can be descriptive, such as a job title.&#x20;

6\) Review your account and click the the **Create user** button to proceed.

7\) Save Keys. You can download a csv and/or save the keys in a text file. After copying this important information, select **Close**.

{% hint style="warning" %}
**It is very important that you copy Access Key ID and Secret Access Key without leaving this page**, because there is no other way to retrieve the **Secret Access Key** later and you will have to start again and create another user.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

8\) After you've copied and saved your AWS secret keys, you will upload your SSH public key. In the top left corner of the page select Services -> EC2. On the left sidebar select Network & Security -> **Key Pairs**. Click the **Import Key Pair** button.

9\) Name this keypair, otherwise the base name of the file will be used (by default `id_rsa`). Browse your Ansible Control Station file system for the public key, or copy/paste:

```
pbcopy < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```

This will copy your public key into your clipboard and can then be pasted.

![Enter a key pair name in step 1 if you don't want to use the base name. ](../../.gitbook/assets/import\_2.png)

9\) Configure aws cli from your local machine:

```
aws configure
```

Provide your credentials (Access Key ID and Secret Access Key) from earlier. Choose a region for your account (e.g. `us-east-2`) and output format (`json` is recommended).

10\) Check the keypair was imported correctly:

```
aws ec2 describe-key-pairs
```

you should see your keypair name in the list in JSON format.
