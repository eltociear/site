# STAKE DeFi

{% hint style="info" %}
* Instructions may use the "xDai Chain" terminology. All processes are the same for the Gnosis Chain.
* [The STAKE/GNO token swap is ongoing](stake-gno-swap.md). STAKE will be phased out over the first half of 2022.&#x20;
* Until the merge, STAKE can still be used in various protocols as well as for staking as a validator or delegator on the Gnosis Chain.
* Rewards are available for various activities related to liquidity provision and lending, and STAKE can be provided to various liquidity pools.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

## STAKE as Collateral

Use STAKE to receive loans in other currencies. Currently, STAKE is available for lending on the following protocols:

* [Agave on xDai](https://app.agave.finance): Receive rewards in AGVE and STAKE in addition to interest for providing collateral on Agave thanks to [this incentives effort](https://forum.poa.network/t/proposal-to-match-stake-incentives-for-agave-on-xdai/7778). You can lend or borrow STAKE as well as other assets here.
* [Kashi on xDai](stake-defi.md#stake-as-collateral): STAKE can be used for lending or borrowing on this Sushi-based lending app.
* [Unit Protocol on Ethereum](https://unit.xyz): Open a CDP (Collateralized Debt Position) with STAKE to borrow USDP.

## STAKE Yield Farming

### Farming on GC

* [Sushiswap](https://app.sushi.com/farm). Receive rewards in SUSHI and STAKE when providing liquidity to incentivized pools within the protocol.

The farms below on xDai also offer STAKE/2nd token pairs where you can add STAKE along with a second asset to a pool and receive fees and rewards. Farming reward tokens are protocol specific and additional reward tokens may be added in the future. Be sure to check each protocol to learn about their specific incentivization programs for yield farming.

* [Swapr](https://swapr.eth.link/#/pools) | SWPR
* [Levinswap](https://farm.levinswap.org) | LEVIN

A [STAKE/WETH pair](https://v2.info.uniswap.org/pair/0x3b3d4eefdc603b232907a7f3d0ed1eea5c62b5f7) is available on Uniswap v2. Note that LPs to this pool also receive STAKE due to the Easy Staking application. Learn more about [this unique incentivization program here](easy-staking/liquidity-provider-lp-info.md).
