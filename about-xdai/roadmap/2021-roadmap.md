# 2021 Base Roadmap

## 2021 Base Roadmap

We continue to add items and adjust priorities as the year unfolds. See the [2020 Roadmap](2020-roadmap-completed-items.md) for items completed in 2020, and the changelog for any adjustments and additions.

_Last update: July 13, 2021 \|_ [_Changelog_](./#change-log)\_\_

{% hint style="warning" %}
The xDai project roadmap is a high-level strategic plan designed to guide xDai research and development. **Target dates and details are reviewed regularly by the team and subject to move, adjust and change as the project evolves**. Note that only completed items \( âœ… Status: Complete\) are considered achieved project milestones.

If you have a direction you would like the xDai team to explore on our roadmap, consider adding a [post to our forum](https://forum.poa.network/c/xdai-chain/xdai-proposals/43) to begin the discussion.

## EasyStaking, POSDAO and Liquidity Pool Analytics

ðŸŽ¯ **Target Date**: Q1 2021  
  **âœ…Status:** MVP Complete. Additions and improvements ongoing. 

* Dune Analytics [Staking Dashboard](https://www.duneanalytics.com/maxaleks/xdai-staking) \(includes EasyStaking & POSDAO; additional metrics ongoing\)
* LP [Distributions dashboard](https://stake-reward-distribution.xdaichain.com/)
* DappQuery [EasyStaking Dashboard](https://dappquery.com/dapp/easystaking-10047)

Analytics or EasyStaking rewards Liquidity Pool \(LP\) participants, stakers in the EasyStaking protocol and POSDAO stakers. [Rewards fluctuate based on numerous factors](../../for-stakers/easy-staking/#liquidity-pool-lp-participants), and additional analytics and dashboards for LPs will be useful for determining staking strategies, reviewing historical outcomes and viewing current statistics. 

We will integrate statistics views for the EasyStaking platform and POSDAO as well as develop additional analytics tools \(currently exploring options like Dune Analytics\). We will continue to add stats and views for stakers on all platforms.

## **Establish Bug Bounty for High Value Contracts**

ðŸŽ¯ **Target Date:** Q2 2021  
  **âœ…Status:** Program Established with [Immunefi](../../for-developers/immunefi-bug-bounty.md)

The first bounty is for OmniBridge contracts with a potential reward of $2,000,000 for critical bug discovery. We will continue to add additional bounties for other infrastructure including EasyStaking and POSDAO consensus contracts.

## **Improve STAKE Governance Processes**

ðŸŽ¯ **Target Date:** Q2 2021  
  **âœ…Status:** Improved [Snapshot Compatibility](https://snapshot.org/#/xdaistake.eth) with xDai, process optimizations ongoing. [More Details](../../for-users/governance/)

STAKE is used for community signaling with [snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/xdaistake.eth), and STAKE held on xDai is important for this process to reflect community sentiment. STAKE holders on xDai include POSDAO delegators and validators, perhaps the biggest supporters of the chain. There is a vital need to include these holders in the governance process. Snapshot compatibility will be expanded to include STAKE on xDai and STAKE currently staked in the POSDAO protocol. In addition, the governance process will be optimized to facilitate more community driven proposals and voting for the [Ecosystem Fund allocation](ecosystem-fund-roadmap.md).

## OmniBridge Phase 2

ðŸŽ¯ **Target Date**: Q1-Q2 2021  
  **âœ…** **Status:** [Security Audit](https://docs.tokenbridge.net/about-tokenbridge/security-audits#omnibridge-audit-by-chainsecurity) Completed by Chain Security April 27, 2021

Additional features include bi-directional support \(ability to move tokens minted on xDai to Ethereum\), relayTokensAndCall functionality, and additional decentralization mechanisms \(governance, additional validators, user-enabled signature execution\). 

## **Berlin HF activation and client updates**

ðŸŽ¯ **Target Date:** May 2021  
  **âœ… Status Update:** **Completed May 17, Block \#16101500**

OpenEthereum is now running `3.2.5` and it includes the latest xDai POSDAO features. xDai validators will upgrade to the latest build, with several also migrating to the Nethermind client to support client diversity on xDai.  

Following the Berlin HF, the gas limit per block was raised from 12.5M to 17M, resulting in 30%+ additional space on the xDai chain. Theoretical TPS for simple transactions at 160+ per second, in practice at 90 per second.

## **POSDAO Staking Application Improvements**

ðŸŽ¯ **Target Date:** Q2 2021  
 **âœ…Complete:** Security Audit Published June 25, 2021

[POSDAO v0.2.2](https://github.com/poanetwork/posdao-contracts/releases/tag/v0.2.2) was released on March 18, 2021 and is now in queue for an additional security audit. POSDAO support is now included with the latest [OpenEthereum release](https://github.com/openethereum/openethereum/releases/tag/v3.2.5).  Additional validator pool metadata was added to the interface.

## Universal NFT Bridge

ðŸŽ¯ **Target Date**: Q3 2021  
âœ… **Status:** Beta complete July 27, 2021

An NFT bridge to allow users easy portability between xDai and Ethereum for all ERC721 tokens. This will improve interoperability and provide options for NFT minting and cross-chain transfers.

{% hint style="info" %}
_Update: Bridge is operational, UI is in development._  [_More information_](https://docs.tokenbridge.net/eth-xdai-amb-bridge/nft-omnibridge-extension)\_\_
{% endhint %}

![UI Preview](../../.gitbook/assets/nft-bridge.png)

## **xDai Grant Program Submissions**

ðŸŽ¯ **Target Date:** Q2**-**Q3 2021  
âœ… **Status:** Early submissions now accepted as of July 1, 2021 for Wave 1 of Grants Program 

We will begin accepting applications for developers and projects requiring support for wave 1 of the Grants Program. Grants awards are TBD as we compile the early submissions and will announce once the program is live.

## **Privacy Preserving Transactions**

ðŸŽ¯ **Target Date:** Q3 2021  
â˜‘ **Status:** In process, defining requirements and exploring approaches

Implementation of additional zero-knowledge protocols and private transactions into xDai.

Since xDai is a stable token, the primary use of the chain is peer-to-peer payments. Just as with cash, privacy and anonymity should be an option when exchanging money or paying vendors for services. 

Currently, [Tornado.cash](https://tornado.cash/) is available to users to ensure Dai anonymity on the Ethereum mainnet. Dai can be used with tornado.cash before and after bridging to xDai to ensure transaction anonymity. However, it is not yet available directly on xDai.

We plan to research and implement privacy preserving transactions on xDai directly, as well as enable privacy for STAKE transactions, allowing for anonymous staking on xDai and Ethereum. We have invested in several [different approaches ](https://forum.poa.network/t/introducing-the-poa-zero-knowledge-fund/2698)to implement different ZK protocols into xDai based applications and wallets.

{% hint style="info" %}
Update: We are currently working on a [ZeroPool](https://zeropool.network/) integration with the bridge infrastructure to provide transaction encryption capabilities.
{% endhint %}

## EIP-1559 Test Implementation

ðŸŽ¯ **Target Date**: Q3 2021  
â˜‘ **Status:** Research and implementation details in progress

We are planning to implement a test implementation of [EIP 1559](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1559)  to explore its dynamics and benefits for the xDai chain as well as the broader Ethereum ecosystem. With successful testing, we plan to activate on xDai. _More details available soon._

## STAKE Beacon Chain

ðŸŽ¯ **Target Date**: Q3 2021  
â˜‘ **Status:** Research and development

In addition to the EIP-1559 implementation we are preparing a STAKE beacon chain deployment. STAKE holders will be able to become validators on this beacon chain implementation with a very small allocation of STAKE \(exact amount TBD, likely 1-10 STAKE\). This will mark a first step towards additional decentralization and allow anyone to participate in the beacon chain experience. The chain will be initially be supported by a single client implementations. _More details coming soon._

## L2 scalability and composability for token transfers on xDai

ðŸŽ¯ **Target Date**: Research ongoing, no definitive end date.

We will research adopting other platforms such as Polkadot, Cosmos, Eth2 and [optimistic rollups](https://docs.ethhub.io/ethereum-roadmap/layer-2-scaling/optimistic_rollups/) deployed to xDai to implement a scalability solution on xDai. This will enable scaling of transfers \(up to 1000x\) for native tokens and synthetic tokens on top of xDai. 

## POSDAO Phase 3

ðŸŽ¯ **Target Date**: Q4**-**Q2 2021-22

A chain created specifically to leverage [POSDAO](../../for-validators/posdao-whitepaper.md), HoneyBadger BFT and Multi-Collateral DAI. This network will be designed from the ground up with our collaborative partners [LUKSO](https://www.lukso.network/) and [ARTIS](https://artis.eco/) to leverage [STAKE ](../../for-stakers/stake-token/)tokens and HBBFT consensus.

## Synthetic Asset Exploration and Implementation

ðŸŽ¯ **Target Date**: Q4 2021  
â˜‘ **Status:** In process. 50% implementation with additional research upcoming.

Explore and implement collateral-based synthetic asset creation on xDai. We plan to leverage an UMA-based protocol. UMA \(Universal Market Access\) is an open-source infrastructure for deploying and enforcing synthetic assets. 

There is currently  a reference implementation where sUSD can be transferred from the Ethereum Mainnet to the xDai chain and back. [sUSD example](https://docs.tokenbridge.net/eth-xdai-amb-bridge/susd-bridge-extension/transfer-susd-through-the-bridge-extension).
