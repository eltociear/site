# Frame

Frame is not a stand-alone wallet, it's a gateway to the DApp ecosystem.  Use the frame browser extension for chrome and firefox as you would MetaMask to connect and interact with DApps. Fully compatible with Trezor and Ledger.  
  
Frame has a friendly user interface and provides secure operations for users along with many useful features like cross-chain compatibility, a real-time fee monitor,  and settings to customize the extension.
