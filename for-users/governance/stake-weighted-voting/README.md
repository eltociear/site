# STAKE weighted voting with Snapshot

STAKE holders participate in the governance process through a [snapshot integration](https://snapshot.page/#/xdaistake.eth). Community members can vote on proposals and introduce proposals for voting by other members. Once a proposal passes, the xDai team works with validators to support the protocol update.&#x20;

Note that proposals are not automatically enacted, and some community proposals may not be accepted depending on the viability of the idea or total STAKE amount/ number of voters participating.

**Who can Vote?**

[Snapshot](https://docs.snapshot.org) voters can use STAKE balances on Ethereum & on xDai. Those holding STAKE in the following ways can vote without needing to change any allocations or parameters.

1. STAKE holders on Ethereum Mainnet and on xDai Chain (STAKE held in an address).
2. STAKE liquidity providers for Uniswap v2 and Uniswap v3 (Ethereum Mainnet).
3. STAKE liquidity providers for SushiSwap (Ethereum Mainnet and xDai Chain). Staked LP token holders are eligible for voting.
4. EasyStaking participants (Ethereum Mainnet).
5. POSDAO validators (xDai Chain).
6. POSDAO delegators (xDai Chain).
7. STAKE liquidity providers for HoneySwap (xDai Chain). Staked LP token holders are eligible for voting.
8. STAKE delegated via Gnosis safe (Ethereum Mainnet and xDai Chain). [More info.](delegate-stake-voting-weight-with-gnosis-safe.md)

Others who want to vote must withdraw STAKE from a protocol to participate. Once the voting period is complete, STAKE can be moved back. Examples of protocols on xDai not supported by snapshot voting include:

* Agave
* Elk finance
* Symmetric
* Swapr

2\) Connect your wallet to Ethereum using MetaMask or another application. This wallet should include the STAKE you want to use for voting purposes (or the connected wallet used with protocols like EasyStaking, Uniswap or Honeyswap. Balances will be combined for your weighted vote).

## Create a Proposal

Community members can create a proposal for a vote. This is the first step in suggesting or enacting an upgrade. If accepted by the community, the xDai team will assess the viability of the idea and see what next steps are required. **A passed vote does not guarantee a protocol change, but is viewed as a community suggestion and taken into consideration by the team.**

1\) Go to the xDai Snapshot Page: [https://snapshot.page/#/xdaistake.eth](https://snapshot.page/#/xdaistake.eth) and connect your  web3 wallet.

2\) Click on New Proposal.
