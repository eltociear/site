# New Validator Process Flow

New Validator candidates should :arrow\_right: [follow the process to become a candidate outlined here](../../for-stakers/staking-protocol/become-a-candidate-validator.md). You will need the minimum amount of STAKE as well as a working node configured with your mining address. **It is best to start at the beginning of a new epoch to give yourself enough time to get everything setup properly**.

You can choose to run either a Nethermind or OpenEthereum client. The [Nethermind](nethermind-node-setup.md) implementation is the recommended choice, [Open Ethereum ](../../for-developers/install-xdai-client/parity.md)is currently being deprecated and future versions may or may not support POSDAO.
