# xDai Dev Team

Igor Barinov is the tech and operations lead and has been involved with Ethereum based projects for years, inventing novel projects and new mechanisms of consensus.

A strong R&D focus on Ethereum Ecosystem has resulted in several meaningful projects developed for the blockchain ecosystem. These include a robust open-source explorer called [BlockScout](https://blockscout.com/xdai/mainnet), which is now the primary explorer for Ethereum Classic and many other chains. They also develop and support [NiftyWallet](https://www.poa.network/for-users/nifty-wallet), a web3 wallet designed to support alternate chains, and built the [TokenBridge](https://docs.tokenbridge.net/), which provides interoperability between different blockchains. These efforts have all come together to create and provide tools for the xDai Stable Chain.

Additional xDai project team leaders include Vadim Arasev \(consensus team lead\), Victor Barinov \(BlockScout + Nifty Wallet team lead\) Alex Kolotov \(TokenBridge lead\), Max Alekseenko \(Decentralized App development\) & Andrew Gross \(technical writer\). Their experience spans not only blockchain development but each brings a unique perspective from fields such as telecommunications, robotics, e-commerce, informatics, computer science.
