## xDai Stable Chain

The xDai chain is a stable payments EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) blockchain designed for fast and inexpensive transactions. The chain uses a unique dual-token model; [xDai ](for-users/get-xdai-tokens/)is a stable token used for transactions, payments, and fees, and [STAKE](for-stakers/stake-token/) is a governance token used to support the underlying [POSDAO Proof-of-Stake](for-validators/posdao-whitepaper.md) consensus.

## **xDai Developers**

Development on xDai is easy and intuitive for Ethereum developers. xDai is an EVM chain, and smart contracts can be written and deployed in exactly the same way simply by setting a [different RPC endpoint.](for-developers/developer-resources/#json-rpc-endpoints)

Any contract that works on the Ethereum mainnet can be redeployed to the xDai chain. On the xDai chain, transaction costs are minimized, and all fees and transactions are paid with a single token, xDai. **Many tools supporting Ethereum development** are compatible with xDai, including:

* [TheGraph](https://thegraph.com)
* [Tenderly](https://tenderly.co)
* [Remix](https://remix-project.org)
* [OpenZeppelin](https://openzeppelin.com)
* [BlockNative](https://www.blocknative.com)
* [Gnosis Safe MultiSig](https://gnosis-safe.io)
* [Dune Analytics](https://duneanalytics.com/home)
* Many more......

* ‚úÖ[STAKE token](for-stakers/stake-token/) for community consensus participation and incentives.&#x20;
* ‚úÖWide-ranging Community Support (see [xDai Validator Organizations](for-validators/about-xdai-validators/original-xdai-validators/)).
* ‚úÖExtreme usability with tools like [Burner Wallet](for-users/wallets/burner-wallet/) & [Burner Wallet 2](for-users/wallets/burner-wallet-2.md).
* ‚úÖGrowing ecosystem designed to support stable person-to-person transactions, micro transactions, [conference currencies](about-xdai/use-cases/cryptocurrency-for-events-and-conferences/), [community currencies](about-xdai/use-cases/community-currencies.md), DeFi, NFTs, DAOs, games and more.
* ‚úÖFull-featured  [BlockScout Explorer](https://blockscout.com/xdai/mainnet).
* ‚úÖOn-chain, decentralized [Random Number Generator](for-developers/on-chain-random-numbers/).
* ‚úÖSmart Contract, DApp & toolset compatibility with other Ethereum-based chains like Ethereum, Ethereum Classic, BSC and others.
* ‚úÖExperiencing the [magic of crypto](about-xdai/news-and-information/media-articles/crypto-influencers-on-xdai.md#anthony-pompliano) for the first time!
